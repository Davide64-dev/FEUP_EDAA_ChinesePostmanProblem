# Evaluation files conventions

## Understanding file names

Examples:

- `5_7_8.txt`: 5 nodes, 7 edges, 8 is the optimal heuristic length of Euler path
- `20_35_44.txt`: 20 nodes, 35 edges, 44 is the optimal heuristic length of Euler path

## Understanding file contents

First line is the number of nodes, each susbsequent line an edge between two nodes separated by a space.
